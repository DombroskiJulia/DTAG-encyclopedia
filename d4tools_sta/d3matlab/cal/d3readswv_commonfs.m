%     
%     Read sensor data and convert to a common sampling rate, fs. 
%     This is useful to make a low sampling rate sensor data set for 
%     overview and calibration. Accepts DTAG3 and DTAG4 sensor data.
%
%     Inputs
%     recdir is the deployment directory e.g., 'e:/eg15/eg15_207a'.
%     prefix is the base part of the name of the files to analyse e.g., 
%        if the files have names like 'eg207a001.wav', put prefix='eg207a'.
%     fs is the target sampling rate. Default value is 5 Hz. 
%     fnums is an optional vector of file numbers to read. The default is
%        to read all files in recdir with names starting with prefix. fnums
%        allows a subset of files to be specified. This is useful if there
%        is a large gap between recordings (e.g., due to duty-cycling) that
%        you do not want to fill to make a contiguous sensor vector.
%
%     Returns:
%     X  is a structure containing:
%        x: a cell array of sensor vectors. There are as many
%        cells in x as there are unique sensor channels in the
%        recording. Each cell may have a different length vector
%        according to the sampling rate of the sensor channel.
%        fs: a vector of sampling rates. Each entry in fs is the
%        sampling rate in Hz of the corresponding cell in x.
%        cn: a vector of channel id numbers corresponding to
%        the cells in x. Use d3channames to get the name and
%        description of each channel.
