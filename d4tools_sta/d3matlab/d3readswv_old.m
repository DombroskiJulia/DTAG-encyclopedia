function    X = d3readswv(recdir,prefix,df)
%    X = d3readswv(recdir,prefix,df)
%     Reads a sequence of D3 format SWV (sensor wav) sensor files
%     and assembles a continuous sensor sequence in x.
%     Calls d3parseswv to read in each file.
%
%     Returns:
%     X  is a structure containing:
%        x: a cell array of sensor vectors. There are as many
%        cells in x as there are unique sensor channels in the
%        recording. Each cell may have a different length vector
%        according to the sampling rate of the sensor channel.
%        fs: a vector of sampling rates. Each entry in fs is the
%        sampling rate in Hz of the corresponding cell in x.
%        cn: a vector of channel id numbers corresponding to
%        the cells in x. Use d3channames to get the name and
%        description of each channel.
