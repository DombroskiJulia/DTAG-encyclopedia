function    [SL,f]=speclev(x,nfft,fs,w,nov)
%
%    [SL,f]=speclev(x,nfft,fs,w,nov)
%     Spectrum level of a signal x.
%     This replaces Matlab's psd function and returns units in dB re
%     root-Hz.
%     x is a vector containing the signal to be processed. For signals with
%     multiple channels, each channel should be in a column of x.
%     nfft is the length of the fft to use. Choose a power of two for
%     fastest operation. Default value is 512.
%     fs is the sampling rate of x in Hz. Default value is 1.
%     w is the window length. The default value is nfft. If w<nfft, each
%     segment of w samples is zero-padded to nfft.
%     nov is the number of samples to overlap each segment. The default
%     value is half of the window length.
%     Use [] in any argument to access the default value or just don't
%     specify the trailing arguments if all of the defaults are to be used, e.g.,
%        [SL,f] = speclev(x,1024) ;
%        [SL,f] = speclev(x,[],48e3) ;
%     Returns:
%     SL is the spectrum level at each frequency in dB RMS re root-Hz.
%        The spectrum is single-sided and extends to fs/2.
%        The reference level is 1.0 (i.e., white noise with unit variance
%        will have a spectrum level of 3-10*log10(fs). The 3dB is because
%        both the negative and positive spectra are added together so that
%        the total power in the signal is the same as the total power in 
%        the spectrum.
%     f  is the vector of frequencies at which SL is calculated.

% 3 is to go from a double-sided spectrum to a single-sided (positive frequency) spectrum.
