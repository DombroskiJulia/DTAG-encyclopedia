function    [H,f,ir] = absorptiontaper(N,fs,d,amin,amax)

%    [H,f,ir] = absorptiontaper(N,fs,d,amin,amax)
%     Estimate the frequency response of a filter that matches
%     the absorption of the ocean over d meters.
%     e.g., [H,f]=absorptiontaper(1024,96e3,1500,-1,-15);
%     N is the number of frequencies to use in the freq. response.
%     fs is the sampling rate, Hz
%     d is the distance in m
%     amin and amax are the minimum and maximum attenuations to
%     avoid numerical problems if inverting the absorption.
%     The depth and temperature are set to 450 m and 12.3 degrees C
%     but can be changed in the script.
%
%     Returns:
%     H is the sampled frequency response (linear) at N frequencies 
%     around the unit circle.
%     f is the vector of frequencies
%     ir is the impulse response of a causal symmetric FIR filter that 
%     can be used to simulate the absorption.
