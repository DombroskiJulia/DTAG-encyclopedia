function   [cl,level,x,X] = getclickx(x,thresh,fs,opts)
%
%     [cl,level,env,X] = getclickx(x,thresh,fs,[opts])
%     Returns the time cue to each click in x, in seconds. Click extraction
%     is done in two steps. First the approximate click locations are found
%     from a conventional low-pass filtered rms envelope. Second, precise
%     envelopes around each candidate click are computed using the hilbert
%     transform. These envelopes are inspected to determine the starting
%     point of each click according to one of several protocols.
%
%     x   is the signal vector
%     thresh is the click detection threshold - try a value of 0.01 to
%         begin with. If thresh=0, only the envelope will be computed (clicks=[]). 
%     fs  is the sampling rate of x.
%     opts is a structure of options containing one or more of the following fields:
%         opts.fh is a scalar of 2-vector specifying a high-pass filter or
%            bandpass filter for the envelope follower [default = 10000Hz].
%            If opts.fh=[], no filter is applied.
%         opts.fl is the low-pass filter frequency for the envelope follower.
%            If opts.fl=[], the Hilbert envelope is computed.
%         opts.blanking is the minimum time between clicks [default = 10ms]
%         opts.protocol is the is the method used to determine where the cue is 
%            declared. Options are: {'first','steepest','max','max-'}. The default 
%            protocol, 'first', returns the first sample in which the pulse magnitude 
%            exceeds the threshold. The 'steepest' protocol returns the cue at which 
%            the envelope exceeds the threshold and has the steepest slope. The 'max' 
%            protocol returns the cue at which the envelope exceeds the threshold and 
%            reaches its maximum value. The 'max-10' protocol returns the cue at which
%            the envelope first exceeds 0.3 of its maximum value. The 'max-6' protocol
%            returns the cue at which the envelope first exceeds 0.5 of its maximum value. 
%         opts.env if this field exists and is set to 1, x is treated as an
%            envelope (i.e., a pre-computed envelope).
%         It is also possible to use a species identifier string in opts e.g.,
%         'sw', 'pw', 'md', 'zc'. The settings most appropriate to that species will 
%         then be used.
%
%     Return variables:
%     cl is the time cue of each click in seconds
%     level is the detection level of each click 
%     env is the rms envelope of x - this is compared against thresh to find clicks.
%     X  is the matrix of hilbert transforms of extracted clicks. The time cue of a click 
%        is the time when the absolute value of the corresponding column of X meets the 
%        selected protocol.
