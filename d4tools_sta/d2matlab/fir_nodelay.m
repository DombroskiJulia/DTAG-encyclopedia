%     Delay-free filtering using a linear-phase FIR filter
%        followed by delay correction.
%     x is the signal to be filtered. It can be multi-channel and 
%        should have a column for each channel.
%     n is the length of symmetric FIR filter to use.
%     fp is the filter cut-off frequency relative to fs/2=1
%     qual is an optional qualifier to pass to fir1.
%     The filter is generated by a call to fir1:
%        h = fir1(n,fp,qual);
%     Optional 2nd output argument returns the filter used.
