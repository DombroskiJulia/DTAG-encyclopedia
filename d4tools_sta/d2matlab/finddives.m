function    T = finddives(p,fs,th,surface,findall)
%
%    T = finddives(p,fs,[th,surface,findall])
%    Find time cues for the edges of dives.
%    p is the depth time series in meters, sampled at fs Hz.
%    th is the threshold in m at which to recognize a dive - dives
%    more shallow than th will be ignored. The default value for th is 10m.
%    surface is the depth in meters at which it is considered that the
%    animal has reached the surface. Default value is 1.
%    findall = 1 forces the algorithm to include incomplete dives at the
%    start and end of the record. Default is 0
%    T is the matrix of cues with columns:
%    [start_cue end_cue max_depth cue_at_max_depth mean_depth mean_compression]
%
%    If there are n dives deeper than th in p, then T will be an nx6 matrix. Partial
%    dives at the beginning or end of the recording will be ignored - only dives that
%    start and end at the surface will appear in T.
