%
%    [ph,K,GL] = findflukes2(Aw,Mw,fs,FR,TH,tmax)
%    EXPERIMENTAL - SUBJECT TO CHANGE!!
%    Find cues to each fluke stroke in Aw. Aw is the whale frame
%    accelerometer matrix at sampling rate fs. Mw is the whale frame
%    magnetometer matrix.
%
%    Optional argument FR should be set equal to the nominal fluking rate 
%    in Hz. This is used to set the cut-off frequency of a low-pass filter.
%    Default value is 0.5 Hz. Use [] to get the default value if you want
%    to enter subsequent arguments. The low-pass filter cut-off frequency
%    is set to one half of FR.
%
%    TH is the magnitude threshold for detecting a fluke stroke in radians.
%    If TH is not given, fluke strokes will not be located (i.e., v=[]) but 
%    the pitch-rate signal (ph) will be computed.
%
%    tmax is the maximum duration allowable for a fluke stroke in seconds. 
%    A fluke stroke is counted whenever there 
%    is a cyclic variation in the pitch deviation with peak-to-peak magnitude 
%    greater than +/-TH and consistent with a fluke stroke of duration
%    less than tmax seconds, e.g., for Mesoplodon choose tmax=4.
%    Default value is 8/FR.
%  
%    Output: 
%    ph is the pitch deviation from mean orientation used to find fluke strokes
%    K is a matrix of cues to zero crossings in seconds (1st column) and
%     zero-crossing directions (2nd column). +1 means a positive-going zero
%     crossing.
%    GL is a matrix containing the start time (first column) and end time
%    (2nd column) of any glides (i.e., no zero crossings in tmax or more
%    seconds).
