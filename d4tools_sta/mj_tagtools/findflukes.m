%    [v,ph,mx,fr] = findflukes(Aw,Mw,fs,FR,TH,T)
%    EXPERIMENTAL - SUBJECT TO CHANGE!!
%    Find cues to each fluke stroke in Aw. Aw is the whale frame
%    accelerometer matrix at sampling rate fs. Mw is the whale frame
%    magnetometer matrix.
%
%    Optional argument FR should be set equal to the nominal fluking rate 
%    in Hz. This is used to set the cut-off frequency of a low-pass filter.
%    Default value is 0.5 Hz. Use [] to get the default value if you want
%    to enter subsequent arguments. The low-pass filter cut-off frequency
%    is set to one quarter of FR.
%
%    TH is the magnitude threshold for detecting a fluke stroke in radians.
%    If TH is not given, fluke strokes will not be located (i.e., v=[]) but 
%    the pitch-rate signal (ph) will be computed.
%
%    T is a 2-vector containing the minimum duration and maximum duration 
%    allowable for a fluke stroke. A fluke stroke is counted whenever there 
%    is a cyclic variation in the pitch deviation with peak-to-peak magnitude 
%    greater than +/-TH and consistent with a fluke stroke of duration
%    between T(1) and T(2) seconds, e.g., for Mesoplodon choose T=[0.7 4].
%    Default value is [1.5/FR 8/FR].
%
%    Use the alternate call type:
%    [v,ph,mx] = findflukes(Aw,[],fs,FR,TH,T)
%    If there is no, or unreliable magnetometer data.
%  
%    Output: v is a vector of cues to fluke strokes in seconds into Aw.
%    ph is the pitch deviation from mean orientation used to find fluke strokes
%    mx is the positive peak level of ph (in radians) for each fluke stroke
%    fr is the fluking rate in flukes-per-second resampled to a 1 second grid
